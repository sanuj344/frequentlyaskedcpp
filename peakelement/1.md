# Find Peak Element (Binary Search Approach)

## Problem

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Return the index of any peak element.

Assume:
- nums[-1] = -∞
- nums[n] = -∞

---

## Example

Input:
{1,2,3,1}

Output:
2

---

## Brute Force Approach

Check every element and verify if it is greater than its neighbors.

Time Complexity: O(n)

---

## Optimal Approach (Binary Search)

### Key Observation

If:
nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]
→ Peak must be on the right.

Else:
→ Peak must be on the left (including mid).

---

## Pseudocode

left = 0
right = n - 1

while left < right:
    mid = (left + right) / 2

    if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]:
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid

return left

---

## Complexity

Time: O(log n)  
Space: O(1)

---

## Why It Works

At least one peak always exists due to boundary conditions.
Binary search narrows toward a peak using slope direction.
