# Dutch National Flag Problem (Sort 0s, 1s, 2s)

## Problem

Given an array containing only 0, 1, and 2,
sort the array in-place in linear time.

---

## Example


Input:
{2,0,2,1,1,0}

Output:
{0,0,1,1,2,2}


---

## Brute Force Approach

### Idea
Simply sort the array.

### Complexity
- Time: O(n log n)
- Space: O(1)

---

## Optimal Approach — Three Pointer Technique

### Idea

Maintain three regions:

0 zone | 1 zone | unknown | 2 zone

Use three pointers:
- low
- mid
- high

---

## Pseudocode


low = 0
mid = 0
high = n - 1

while mid <= high:

if arr[mid] == 0:
    swap arr[low] and arr[mid]
    low++
    mid++

else if arr[mid] == 1:
    mid++

else:
    swap arr[mid] and arr[high]
    high--

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

---

## Why It Works

The algorithm partitions the array into three sections
in a single traversal.

## Interview Tip

This is a partitioning problem similar to Quick Sort.
